# Unity Machine Learning and Flappy Bird

I trained a machine learning model using Unitiy MachineLearning Agents 0.3 to play Flappy Bird.

You will need the following to get this up and running:

* Unity 2017.3
* Unity Machine Learning Agents 0.3


The initial game is from the Unity web site, if you want to build it on your own, just follow the videos from here:
